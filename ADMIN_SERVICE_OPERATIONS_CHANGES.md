# Admin Service Operations Changes

## Overview
Implemented a new separate schema and API for admin service operations to store full worker names, roles, and prices for easy identification and management.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Admin Service Operations Schema (`app/models/AdminServiceOperation.ts`)

**Structure:**
```javascript
{
  name: "Service Name",
  price: fullPrice, // Full original price
  status: "pending" | "finished",
  createdAt: Date,
  workerName: "Full Worker Name",
  workerRole: "barber" | "washer",
  workerId: "worker_id",
  branchId: "branch_id"
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  name: "chgri ms motkorya",
  price: 125, // Full price
  status: "pending",
  createdAt: "2025-07-31T09:20:44.117+00:00",
  workerName: "John Doe",
  workerRole: "barber",
  workerId: "worker_id_123",
  branchId: "branch_id_456"
}
```

### 2. New Admin Service Operations API (`app/api/admin/service-operations/route.ts`)

**Features:**
- **POST**: Creates admin service operations with full worker information
- **GET**: Retrieves admin service operations for a branch
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are present
- **Authentication**: Admin-only access

### 3. Updated Worker Service Operations (`app/api/users/service-operations/route.ts`)

**Changes:**
- **Removed**: `otherWorker` field from all service operations
- **Simplified**: Each worker only sees their own operations
- **Maintained**: Price calculations (50% for barber, 10% for washer)

### 4. Updated Admin Dashboard (`app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- **Dual API Calls**: Sends data to both worker and admin APIs
- **Enhanced History Table**: Shows worker names, roles, and full prices
- **Cleaner Display**: Separate columns for worker name and role
- **Better Organization**: Each service operation shows individual worker assignments

**History Table Structure:**
| Service | Full Price | Worker Name | Worker Role | Status | Date Created |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Haircut | $200 | John Doe | barber | pending | 2025-07-31 |

### 5. Updated Worker Dashboards

**Barber Dashboard (`app/dashboard/barber/page.tsx`):**
- **Removed**: `otherWorker` references
- **Simplified**: Shows only barber's own operations
- **Clear**: 50% share calculation display

**Washer Dashboard (`app/dashboard/washer/page.tsx`):**
- **Removed**: `otherWorker` references  
- **Simplified**: Shows only washer's own operations
- **Clear**: 10% share calculation display

## Data Flow

### When Admin Submits Services:

1. **Worker API**: Creates service operations with calculated prices
   - Barber gets 50% of their assigned price
   - Washer gets 10% of their assigned price
   - No `otherWorker` information

2. **Admin API**: Creates service operations with full information
   - Full original prices
   - Complete worker names and roles
   - Easy identification and management

### Example Flow:

**Service**: Haircut + Wash
**Original Prices**: Barber $200, Washer $50

**Worker Database** (User.serviceOperations):
```javascript
// Barber's record
{
  name: "Haircut + Wash",
  price: 100, // 50% of $200
  originalPrice: 200,
  status: "pending"
}

// Washer's record  
{
  name: "Haircut + Wash", 
  price: 5, // 10% of $50
  originalPrice: 50,
  status: "pending"
}
```

**Admin Database** (AdminServiceOperation):
```javascript
// Barber operation
{
  name: "Haircut + Wash",
  price: 200, // Full price
  workerName: "John Doe",
  workerRole: "barber",
  status: "pending"
}

// Washer operation
{
  name: "Haircut + Wash", 
  price: 50, // Full price
  workerName: "Jane Smith",
  workerRole: "washer", 
  status: "pending"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Worker Identification**: Admin can easily see who is assigned to each service
2. **Full Price Transparency**: Admin sees complete pricing information
3. **Simplified Worker Views**: Workers only see their own operations without confusion
4. **Better Data Organization**: Separate schemas for different purposes
5. **Easy Management**: Admin can track all operations with worker details

## Testing

To test the changes:
1. Login as admin and create service operations
2. Check admin history shows worker names and full prices
3. Login as barber/washer and verify simplified view
4. Confirm no `otherWorker` information appears in worker dashboards
